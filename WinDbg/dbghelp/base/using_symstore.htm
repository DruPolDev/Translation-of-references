<H1><A NAME="base.using_symstore"></A>Using SymStore</H1>
<P>SymStore (symstore.exe) is a tool for creating symbol stores. It is included in the Debugging Tools for Windows package.</P>
<P>SymStore stores symbols in a format that enables the debugger to look up the symbols based on the time stamp and size of the image (for a .dbg or executable file), or signature and age (for a .pdb file). The advantage of the symbol store over the traditional symbol storage format is that all symbols can be stored or referenced on the same server and retrieved by the debugger without any prior knowledge of which product contains the corresponding symbol.</P>
<P>Note that multiple versions of .pdb symbol files (for example, public and private versions) cannot be stored on the same server, because they each contain the same signature and age.</P>
<H4><A NAME="symstore_transactions"></A>SymStore Transactions</H4>
<P>Every call to SymStore is recorded as a transaction. There are two types of transactions: add and delete.</P>
<P>When the symbol store is created, a directory, called "000admin", is created under the root of the server. The 000admin directory contains one file for each transaction, as well as the log files Server.txt and History.txt. The Server.txt file contains a list of all transactions that are currently on the server. The History.txt file contains a chronological history of all transactions.</P>
<P>Each time SymStore stores or removes symbol files, a new transaction number is created. Then, a file, whose name is this transaction number, is created in 000admin. This file contains a list of all the files or pointers that have been added to the symbol store during this transaction. If a transaction is deleted, SymStore will read through its transaction file to determine which files and pointers it should delete.</P>
<P>The <B>add</B> and <B>del</B> options specify whether an add or delete transaction is to be performed. Including the <B>/p</B> option with an add operation specifies that a pointer is to be added; omitting the <B>/p</B> option specifies that the actual symbol file is to be added.</P>
<P>It is also possible to create the symbol store in two separate stages. In the first stage, you use SymStore with the <B>/x</B> option to create an index file. In the second stage, you use SymStore with the <B>/y</B> option to create the actual store of files or pointers from the information in the index file.</P>
<P>This can be a useful technique for a variety of reasons. For instance, this allows the symbol store to be easily recreated if the store is somehow lost, as long as the index file still exists. Or perhaps the computer containing the symbol files has a slow network connection to the computer on which the symbol store will be created. In this case, you can create the index file on the same machine as the symbol files, transfer the index file to the second machine, and then create the store on the second machine.</P>
<P>For a full listing of all SymStore parameters, see 
<A HREF="symstore_command_line_options.htm">SymStore Command-Line Options</A>.</P>
<P CLASS="note"><B>Note</B>  SymStore does not support simultaneous transactions from multiple users. It is recommended that one user be designated "administrator" of the symbol store and be responsible for all <B>add</B> and <B>del</B> transactions.</P>
<H4><A NAME="transaction_examples"></A>Transaction Examples</H4>
<P>Here are two examples of SymStore adding symbol pointers for build 2195 of Windows 2000 to \\sampledir\symsrv:</P>
<H4></H4><P></P><DIV class="codeSnippet"><PRE xml:space="preserve" class="syntax">symstore add /r /p /f \\BuildServer\BuildShare\2195free\symbols\*.*
   /s \\sampledir\symsrv /t "Windows 2000" /v "Build 2195 x86 free"
   /c "Sample add"
symstore add /r /p /f \\BuildServer\BuildShare\2195free\symbols\*.* 
   /s \\sampledir\symsrv /t "Windows 2000" /v "Build 2195 x86 checked"
   /c "Sample add"</PRE></DIV>
<P>In the following example, SymStore adds the actual symbol files for an application project in \\largeapp\appserver\bins to \\testdir\symsrv:</P>
<H4></H4><P></P><DIV class="codeSnippet"><PRE xml:space="preserve" class="syntax">symstore add /r /f \\largeapp\appserver\bins\*.* /s \\testdir\symsrv 
   /t "Large Application" /v "Build 432" /c "Sample add"</PRE></DIV>
<P>Here is an example of how an index file is used. First, SymStore creates an index file based on the collection of symbol files in \\largeapp\appserver\bins\. In this case, the index file is placed on a third computer, \\hubserver\hubshare. You use the <B>/g</B> option to specify that the file prefix "\\largeapp\appserver" might change in the future:</P>
<H4></H4><P></P><DIV class="codeSnippet"><PRE xml:space="preserve" class="syntax">symstore add /r /p /g \\largeapp\appserver /f 
   \\largeapp\appserver\bins\*.* 
   /x \\hubserver\hubshare\myindex.txt</PRE></DIV>
<P>Now suppose you move all the symbol files off of the machine \\largeapp\appserver and put them on \\myarchive\appserver. You can then create the symbol store itself from the index file \\hubserver\hubshare\myindex.txt as follows:</P>
<H4></H4><P></P><DIV class="codeSnippet"><PRE xml:space="preserve" class="syntax">symstore add /y \\hubserver\hubshare\myindex.txt 
   /g \\myarchive\appserver /s \\sampledir\symsrv /p 
   /t "Large Application" /v "Build 432" /c "Sample Add from Index"</PRE></DIV>
<P>Finally, here is an example of SymStore deleting a file added by a previous transaction. See the following section for an explanation of how to determine the transaction ID (in this case, 0000000096).</P>
<H4></H4><P></P><DIV class="codeSnippet"><PRE xml:space="preserve" class="syntax">symstore del /i 0000000096 /s \\sampledir\symsrv</PRE></DIV>
<H4><A NAME="compressed_files"></A>Compressed Files</H4>
<P>SymStore can be used with compressed files in two different ways.</P>
<ol>
<li>Use SymStore with the <B>/p</B> option to store pointers to the symbol files. After SymStore finishes, compress the files that the pointers refer to.</li>
<li>Use SymStore with the <B>/x</B> option to create an index file. After SymStore finishes, compress the files listed in the index file. Then use SymStore with the <B>/y</B> option (and, if you wish, the <B>/p</B> option) to store the files or pointers to the files in the symbol store. (SymStore will not need to uncompress the files to perform this operation.)</li>
</ol>
<P>Your symbol server will be responsible for uncompressing the files when they are needed.</P>
<P>If you are using SymSrv as your symbol server, any compression should be done using the compress.exe tool that is distributed with the Platform SDK. Compressed files should have an underscore as the last character in their file extensions (for example, module1.pd_ or module2.db_). For details, see 
<A HREF="using_symsrv.htm">Using SymSrv</A>.</P>
<H4><A NAME="the_server.txt_and_history.txt_files"></A>The server.txt and history.txt Files</H4>
<P>When a transaction is added, several items of information are added to server.txt and history.txt for future lookup capability. The following is an example of a line in server.txt and history.txt for an add transaction:</P>
<H4></H4><P></P><DIV class="codeSnippet"><PRE xml:space="preserve" class="syntax">0000000096,add,ptr,10/09/99,00:08:32,Windows NT 4.0 SP 4,x86 fre 1.156c-RTM-2,Added from \\mybuilds\symbols,</PRE></DIV>

<P>SymStore uses the file system itself as a database. It creates a large tree of directories, with directory names based on such things as the symbol file time stamps, signatures, age, and other data.</P>
<P>For example, after several different acpi.dbg files have been added to the server, the directories could look like this:</P>
<H4></H4><P></P><DIV class="codeSnippet"><PRE xml:space="preserve">Directory of \\mybuilds\symsrv\acpi.dbg

<P>In this example, the lookup path for the acpi.dbg symbol file might look something like this: \\mybuilds\symsrv\acpi.dbg\37cdb03962040.</P>
<P>Three files may exist inside the lookup directory:</P>
<ol>
<li>If the file was stored, then acpi.dbg will exist there.</li>
<li>If a pointer was stored, then a file called file.ptr will exist and contain the path to the actual symbol file.</li>
<li>A file called refs.ptr, which contains a list of all the current locations for acpi.dbg with this timestamp and image size that are currently added to the symbol store.</li>
</ol>
<P>Displaying the directory listing of \\mybuilds\symsrv\acpi.dbg\37cdb03962040 gives the following:</P>
<H4></H4><P></P><DIV class="codeSnippet"><PRE xml:space="preserve">10/04/1999  01:54p                  52 file.ptr
10/04/1999  01:54p                  67 refs.ptr</PRE></DIV>
<P>The file file.ptr contains the text string "\\mybuilds\symbols\x86\2128.chk\symbols\sys\acpi.dbg". Since there is no file called acpi.dbg in this directory, the debugger will try to find the file at \\mybuilds\symbols\x86\2128.chk\symbols\sys\acpi.dbg.</P>
<P>The contents of refs.ptr are used only by SymStore, not the debugger. This file contains a record of all transactions that have taken place in this directory. A sample line from refs.ptr might be:</P>
<H4></H4><P></P><DIV class="codeSnippet"><PRE xml:space="preserve">0000000026,ptr,\\mybuilds\symbols\x86\2128.chk\symbols\sys\acpi.dbg</PRE></DIV>
<P>This shows that a pointer to \\mybuilds\symbols\x86\2128.chk\symbols\sys\acpi.dbg was added with transaction "0000000026".</P>
<P>Some symbol files stay constant through various products or builds or a particular product. One example of this is the Windows 2000 file msvcrt.pdb. Doing a directory of \\mybuilds\symsrv\msvcrt.pdb shows that only two versions of msvcrt.pdb have been added to the symbols server:</P>
<H4></H4><P></P><DIV class="codeSnippet"><PRE xml:space="preserve">Directory of \\mybuilds\symsrv\msvcrt.pdb
10/06/1999  05:37p      &lt;DIR&gt;          .

10/06/1999  05:37p      &lt;DIR&gt;          37f2c2272</PRE></DIV>
<P>However, doing a directory of \\mybuilds\symsrv\msvcrt.pdb\37a8f40e2 shows that refs.ptr has several pointers in it.</P>
<H4></H4><P></P><DIV class="codeSnippet"><PRE xml:space="preserve">Directory of \\mybuilds\symsrv\msvcrt.pdb\37a8f40e2

<P>Thus, transactions 43, 44, and 45 added the same file to the server, and transactions 46 and 47 added pointers. If transactions 43, 44, and 45 are deleted, then the file dbghelp.dbg will be deleted from the directory. The directory will then have the following contents:</P>

<P>A <I>symbol file</I> contains the same debugging information that an executable file would contain. However, the information is stored in a debug (.dbg) file or a program database (.pdb), rather than the executable file. Therefore, you can install only the symbol files you will need during debugging. This reduces the file size of the executable, saving load time and disk storage.</P>
<P>Debuggers can determine whether an executable file or DLL contains debugging information by searching for the IMAGE_FILE_DEBUG_STRIPPED characteristic. If this characteristic is present, the debugging information exists in a symbol file.</P>
<P>To create a .dbg file, build your executable file with debugging information according to the directions for your build tools. Next, use the 
<A HREF="splitsymbols.htm"><b>SplitSymbols</b></A> function. The resulting .dbg file uses the PE format.</P>
<P>To create a .pdb file, build your executable file with debugging information according to the directions for your build tools.</P>
<P>The operating system dynamic-link libraries (DLL) have associated symbol files. These .pdb files are not installed during installation. To install the system symbol files, create a directory on your hard disk, and copy the files from your system installation compact disc (CD). The symbol files are located in the SUPPORT\DEBUG\I386\SYMBOLS directory tree.</P>
<P>To work with the symbolic debugging information contained in a symbol file, use the 
<A HREF="symbol_handling.htm">symbol handling</A> functions.</P><br><P><A HREF="mailto:wsddocfb@microsoft.com?subject=Documentation%20feedback [base]:%20Symbol Files%20 RELEASE:%20(9/25/2007)&amp;body=%0A%0APRIVACY STATEMENT%0A%0AThe SDK team uses the feedback submitted to improve the SDK documentation.

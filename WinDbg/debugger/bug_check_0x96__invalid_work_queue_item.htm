<p>The INVALID_WORK_QUEUE_ITEM bug check has a value of 0x00000096. This bug check indicates that a queue entry was removed that contained a <b>NULL</b> pointer.<p></p>

<div class="alert"><b>Important </b>This topic is for programmers. If you are a customer who has received a blue screen error code while using your computer, see

<h2> INVALID_WORK_QUEUE_ITEM Parameters</h2>
<p>The following parameters appear on the blue screen.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>1</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The address of the queue entry whose <b>flink</b> or <b>blink</b> field is <b>NULL</b>. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>2</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The address of the queue that is being referenced. Typically, this queue is an <b>ExWorkerQueue</b>. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>3</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The base address of the <b>ExWorkerQueue</b> array. (This address helps you determine if the queue in question is indeed an <b>ExWorkerQueue</b>. If the queue is an <b>ExWorkerQueue</b>, the offset from this parameter will isolate the queue.)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>4</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Assuming the queue is an <b>ExWorkerQueue</b>, this value is the address of the worker routine that would have been called if the work item had been valid. (You can use this address to isolate the driver that is misusing the work queue.) </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> </p>
<h2>Cause</h2>
<p>The INVALID_WORK_QUEUE_ITEM bug check occurs when <b>KeRemoveQueue</b> removes a queue entry whose <b>flink</b> or <b>blink</b> field is <b>NULL</b>.</p>
<p>Any queue misuse can cause this error. But typically this error occurs because worker thread work items are misused.</p>
<p>An entry on a queue can be inserted on the list only one time. When an item is removed from a queue, its <b>flink</b> field is set to <b>NULL</b>. Then, when this item is removed the second time, this bug check occurs.</p>
<p>In most situations, the queue that is being referenced is an <b>ExWorkerQueue</b> (executive worker queue). To help identify the driver that caused the error, Parameter 4 displays the address of the worker routine that would have been called if this work item had been valid. However, if the queue that is being referenced is not an <b>ExWorkerQueue</b>, this parameter is not useful.</p>

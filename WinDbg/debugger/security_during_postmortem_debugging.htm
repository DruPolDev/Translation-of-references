<p>Only an administrator can enable <a href="enabling_postmortem_debugging.htm">postmortem debugging</a>.</p>
<p>However, postmortem debugging is enabled for the entire system, not just for one user. Thus, after it has been enabled, any application crash will activate the debugger that has been chosen -- even if the current user does not have administrative privileges.</p>
<p>Also, a postmortem debugger inherits the same privileges as the application that crashed. Thus, if a Windows service such as CSRSS and LSASS crashes, the debugger will have very high-level privileges.</p>
<p>You should take this into account when choosing to enable postmortem debugging.</p>

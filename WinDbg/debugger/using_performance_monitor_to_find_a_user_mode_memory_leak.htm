</div>
<p>If you suspect there is a user-mode memory leak but are not sure which process is causing it, you can use Performance Monitor to measure the memory usage of individual processes.</p>
<p>Launch Performance Monitor. Add the following counters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Process</b>--&gt;<b>Private Bytes</b> (for each process you want to examine) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Process</b>--&gt;<b>Virtual Bytes</b> (for each process you wish to examine) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Change the update time to 600 seconds to capture a graph of the leak over time. You might also want to log the data to a file for later examination.</p>
<p>The <b>Private Bytes</b> counter indicates the total amount of memory that a process has allocated, not including memory shared with other processes. The <b>Virtual Bytes</b> counter indicates the current size of the virtual address space that the process is using.</p>
<p>Some memory leaks appear in the data file as an increase in private bytes allocated. Other memory leaks show up as an increase in the virtual address space.</p>
<p>After you have determined which process is leaking memory,  use the UMDH tool to determine the specific routine that is at fault. For details, see <a href="using_umdh_to_find_a_user_mode_memory_leak.htm">Using UMDH to Find User-Mode Memory Leaks</a>.</p>

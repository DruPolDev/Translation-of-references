<p>In KD, you can view and edit memory by entering one of the <a href="d__da__db__dc__dd__dd__df__dp__dq__du__dw__dw__dyb__dyd__display_memor.htm"><b>Display Memory</b></a> commands, and you can edit memory by entering one of the <a href="e__ea__eb__ed__ed__ef__ep__eq__eu__ew__eza__ezu__enter_values_.htm"><b>Enter Values</b></a> commands. For a detailed discussion of these commands, see <a href="accessing_memory_by_virtual_address.htm">Accessing Memory by Virtual Address</a> and <a href="accessing_memory_by_physical_address.htm">Accessing Memory by Physical Address</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="Viewing_and_Editing_Variables"></a><a id="viewing_and_editing_variables"></a><a id="VIEWING_AND_EDITING_VARIABLES"></a>Viewing and Editing Variables</h2>
<p>In KD, you can view and edit global variables by entering commands. The debugger interprets the name of a global variable as a virtual address. Therefore, all of the commands that are described in <a href="accessing_memory_by_virtual_address.htm">Accessing Memory by Virtual Address</a> can be used to read or write global variables. For additional information about viewing and editing global variables, see <a href="accessing_global_variables.htm">Accessing Global Variables</a>.</p>
<p>In KD you can view and edit local variables by entering commands. The debugger interprets the name of a local variable as an address. Therefore, all of the commands that are described in <a href="accessing_memory_by_virtual_address.htm">Accessing Memory by Virtual Address</a> can be used to read or write local variables. However, if it is necessary to indicate to a command that a symbol is local, precede the symbol with a dollar sign ( $ ) and an exclamation point ( ! ), as in <code>$!var</code>. For additional information about viewing and editing local variables, see <a href="accessing_local_variables.htm">Accessing Local Variables</a>.</p>

<p>When a thread needs exclusive access to code or some other resource, it requests a <i>lock</i>. If it can, Windows responds by giving this lock to the thread. At this point, nothing else in the system can access the locked code. This happens all the time and is a normal part of any well-written multithreaded application. Although a particular code segment can only have one lock on it at a time, multiple code segments can each have their own lock.</p>
<p>A <i>deadlock</i> arises when two or more threads have requested locks on two or more resources, in an incompatible sequence.  For instance, suppose that Thread One has acquired a lock on Resource A and then requests access to Resource B.  Meanwhile, Thread Two has acquired a lock on Resource B and then requests access to Resource A.  Neither thread can proceed until the other thread's lock is relinquished, and, therefore, neither thread can proceed. </p>
<p>User-mode deadlocks arise when multiple threads of one application have blocked each others' access to the same resources.  Kernel-mode deadlocks arise when multiple threads (from the same process or from distinct processes) have blocked each others' access to the same kernel resource.  The procedure used to debug a deadlock depends on whether the deadlock occurs in user mode or in kernel mode.</p>
<h3><a id="debugging_a_user_mode_deadlock"></a><a id="DEBUGGING_A_USER_MODE_DEADLOCK"></a>Debugging a User-Mode Deadlock</h3>
<p>When a deadlock occurs in user mode, use the following procedure to debug it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Issue the <a href="_locks___ntsdexts_locks_.htm"><b>!ntsdexts.locks</b></a> extension. In user mode, you can just type <b>!locks</b> at the debugger prompt; the <b>ntsdexts</b> prefix is assumed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This extension displays all the critical sections associated with the current process, along with the ID for the owning thread and the lock count for each critical section. If a critical section has a lock count of zero, it is not locked. Use the <a href="___thread_status_.htm"><b>~ (Thread Status)</b></a> command to see information about the threads that own the other critical sections. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <a href="k__kb__kc__kd__kp__kp__kv__display_stack_backtrace_.htm"><b>kb (Display Stack Backtrace)</b></a> command for each of these threads to determine whether they are waiting on other critical sections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the output of these <b>kb</b> commands, you can find the deadlock: two threads that are each waiting on a lock held by the other thread. In rare cases, a deadlock could be caused by more than two threads holding locks in a circular pattern, but most deadlocks involve only two threads.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an illustration of this procedure.  You begin with the <b>!ntdexts.locks</b> extension: </p>

<p>The first critical section displayed has no locks and, therefore, can be ignored.</p>
<p>The second critical section displayed has a lock count of 2 and is, therefore, a possible cause of a deadlock. The owning thread has a thread ID of 0xA3.</p>
<p>You can find this thread by listing all threads with the <a href="___thread_status_.htm"><b>~ (Thread Status)</b></a> command, and looking for the thread with this ID:</p>

<p>In this display, the first item is the debugger's internal thread number. The second item (the <code>Id</code> field) contains two hexadecimal numbers separated by a decimal point. The number before the decimal point is the process ID; the number after the decimal point is the thread ID. In this example, you see that thread ID 0xA3 corresponds to thread number 4.</p>
<p>You then use the <a href="k__kb__kc__kd__kp__kp__kv__display_stack_backtrace_.htm"><b>kb (Display Stack Backtrace)</b></a> command to display the stack that corresponds to thread number 4:</p>

<p>Notice that this thread has a call to the <b>WaitForCriticalSection</b> function, which means that not only does it have a lock, it is waiting for code that is locked by something else. We can find out which critical section we are waiting on by looking at the first parameter of the call to <b>WaitForCriticalSection</b>. This is the first address under <b>Args to Child</b>: "24e750".  So this thread is waiting on the critical section at address 0x24E750. This was the third critical section listed by the <b>!locks</b> extension that you used earlier.</p>
<p>In other words, thread 4, which owns the second critical section, is waiting on the third critical section. Now turn your attention to the third critical section, which is also locked. The owning thread has thread ID 0xA9. Returning to the output of the <b>~</b> command that you saw previously, note that the thread with this ID is thread number 6.  Display the stack backtrace for this thread:</p>

<p>This thread, too, is waiting for a critical section to be freed. In this case, it is waiting on the critical section at 0x68629100. This was the second critical section in the list generated earlier by the <b>!locks</b> extension.</p>
<p>This is the deadlock. Thread 4, which owns the second critical section, is waiting on the third critical section. Thread 6, which owns the third critical section, is waiting on the second critical section. </p>
<p>Having confirmed the nature of this deadlock, you can use the usual debugging techniques to analyze threads 4 and 6.</p>
<h3><a id="debugging_a_kernel_mode_deadlock"></a><a id="DEBUGGING_A_KERNEL_MODE_DEADLOCK"></a>Debugging a Kernel-Mode Deadlock</h3>
<p>There are several debugger extensions that are useful for debugging deadocks in kernel mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="_locks___kdext__locks_.htm"><b>!kdexts.locks</b></a> extension displays information about all locks held on kernel resources and the threads holding these locks. (In kernel mode, you can just type <b>!locks</b> at the debugger prompt; the <b>kdexts</b> prefix is assumed.) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="_qlocks.htm"><b>!qlocks</b></a> extension displays the state of all queued spin locks. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="_deadlock.htm"><b>!wdfkd.wdfspinlock</b></a> extension displays information about a Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) spin-lock object. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="_deadlock.htm"><b>!deadlock</b></a> extension is used in conjunction with Driver Verifier to detect inconsistent use of locks in your code that have the potential to cause deadlocks. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When a deadlock occurs in kernel mode, use the <b>!kdexts.locks</b> extension to list all the locks currently acquired by threads.</p>
<p>You can usually pinpoint the deadlock by finding one non-executing thread that holds an exclusive lock on a resource that is required by an executing thread. Most of the locks are shared.</p>

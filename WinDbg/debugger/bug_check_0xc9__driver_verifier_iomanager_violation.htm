<p>In addition to the errors mentioned in the previous table, there are a number of <b>I/O Verification</b> errors that will cause Driver Verifier to halt the system, but which are not actually bug checks.</p>
<p>These errors cause messages to be displayed on the blue screen, in a crash dump file, and in a kernel debugger. These messages will appear differently in each of these locations. When these errors occur, the hexadecimal bug check code 0xC9 and the bug check string DRIVER_VERIFIER_IOMANAGER_VIOLATION do <u>not</u> appear on the blue screen or in the debugger, although they will appear in a crash dump file.</p>
<p>On the blue screen, the following data will be displayed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The message <b>IO SYSTEM VERIFICATION ERROR</b>.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The message <b>WDM DRIVER ERROR </b><i>XXX</i>, where <i>XXX</i> is a hexadecimal code representing the specific error. (See the table below for a list of the I/O error codes and their meanings.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name of the driver which caused the error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The address in the driver's code where the error was detected (Parameter 2). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pointer to the IRP (Parameter 3). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pointer to the device object (Parameter 4). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If a kernel-mode crash dump has been enabled, the following information will appear in the crash dump file:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The message <b>BugCheck 0xC9 (DRIVER_VERIFIER_IOMANAGER_VIOLATION)</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hexadecimal I/O error code. (See the table below for a list of the I/O error codes and their meanings.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The address in the driver's code where the error was detected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pointer to the IRP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pointer to the device object.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If a kernel debugger is attached to the system which has caused this violation, the following information will be sent to the debugger:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The message <b>WDM DRIVER ERROR</b>, along with an assessment of the severity of the error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name of the driver which caused the error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A descriptive string which explains the cause of this error. Often additional information is passed along, such as a pointer to the IRP. (See the table below for a list of these descriptive strings and what additional information is specified.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A query for further action. Possible responses are <b>b</b> (break), <b>i</b> (ignore), <b>z</b> (zap), <b>r</b> (remove), or <b>d</b> (disable). Instructing the operating system to continue allows you to see what would happen "down the line" if this error had not occurred. Of course, this often will lead to additional bug checks. The "zap" option will actually remove the breakpoint that caused this error to be discovered. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    No other bug checks can be ignored in this manner. Only this kind of <b>I/O Verification</b> errors can be ignored, and even these errors can only be ignored if a kernel debugger is attached.</div>

<h2>Cause</h2>
<p>See the description of each code in the Parameters section for a description of the cause.</p>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>This bug check can only occur when Driver Verifier has been instructed to monitor one or more drivers. If you did not intend to use Driver Verifier, you should deactivate it. You might consider removing the driver which caused this problem as well.</p>
<p>If you are the driver writer, use the information obtained through this bug check to fix the bugs in your code.</p>

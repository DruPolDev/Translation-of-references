</div>
<p>In general, data is moved downstream only by triggering events, the minidriver's processing, and buffer completions. To isolate the cause of a hang or stall:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>  Check for mismatched <b>KsGate<i>Xxx</i></b> calls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  Check for omitted <b>Ks<i>Xxx</i>AttemptProcessing</b> calls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  Look for problems in code related to triggering events, including code that either references the pin flags for the problem stream or that calls <b>KsPinAttemptProcessing</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  Look for problems in the code related to the processing dispatch, in particular where it queues to hardware and where clone pointers are created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  Look for problems in the code related to the driver's deferred procedure call (DPC), especially where buffers are completed or any calls are made to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=56550">KsStreamPointerDelete</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>  Look for problems in the startup code for the stream.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The most effective way to collect this information is by logging everything in the affected region, including processing, buffer acquisition (such as cloning and programming hardware), buffer release (such as deleting clones), and any gate manipulations. Most of this information is highly timing dependent and requires memory-based logging or ETW.</p>
<p>To maintain a rolling memory-based log, use the following code:</p>
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>typedef struct _LOGENTRY {
    ULONG Tag;
    ULONG Arg[3];
} LOGENTRY, *PLOGENTRY;
#define LOGSIZE 2048
LONG g_LogCount;
LOGENTRY g_Log [LOGSIZE];
#define LOG(tag,arg1,arg2,arg3) do { \
    LONG i = InterlockedIncrement (&amp;g_LogCount) % LOGSIZE; \
    g_Log [i].Tag = tag; \
    g_Log [i].Arg [0] = (ULONG)(arg1); \
    g_Log [i].Arg [1] = (ULONG)(arg2); \
    g_Log [i].Arg [2] = (ULONG)(arg3); \
} while (0)</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
<p>Then, use a simple "dc g_Log" to view the contents of the <b>g_Log</b> array in the debugger.</p>
<p>The following example uses the above memory-based scheme to determine the cause of a processing stall. Output is from an AVStream streaming scenario in graphedt. The following minidriver events were logged:</p>

<p>This first log excerpt is representative of the normal streaming state. In the first line, the minidriver's <i>CallOnDPC</i> is called to complete a buffer (<i>DPC&lt;</i>). The buffer is deleted (<i>Dele</i>), and <b>KsPinAttemptProcessing</b> is called to move the leading edge forward, if there are any unprocessed buffers in the queue (<i>Atmp</i>). In this case, there were, as can be seen by the call to the process dispatch (<i>Prc&lt;</i>). More buffers are added to the queue (<i>AddB</i>), and the whole scenario repeats.  </p>
<p>This next excerpt includes the last entries in the log right before the stall occurred.</p>

<p>In this example, several buffers are being completed (indicated by the repeated instances of <i>DPC&lt;</i>), but there are no unprocessed buffers in the queue, so the process dispatch is not being called (indicated by the absence of <i>Prc&lt;</i>). In fact, all of the processed buffers in the queue have been completed, apparently before any new unprocessed buffers could be added. Because the application is already running (so that <i>Start</i> will not be called) and no calls are being made to <i>CallOnDPC</i> (because there are no processed buffers ready to be completed), any new buffers are apparently accumulating ahead of the leading edge, waiting to be processed, with nothing initiating processing.  </p>
<p>The problem is that the KSPIN_FLAG_DO_NOT_INITIATE_PROCESSING flag has been set. When this flag is set, processing occurs only through a call to <i>Start</i> or <i>CallOnDPC</i>. If this flag is not set, processing will be initiated whenever new buffers are added to the queue.</p>

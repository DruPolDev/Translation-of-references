<h2>Cause</h2>
<p>A driver has called <b>IoCompleteRequest</b> to ask that an IRP be completed, but the packet has already been completed.</p>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>This is a tough bug to find because the simplest case -- a driver that attempted to complete its own packet twice -- is usually not the source of the problem. More likely, two separate drivers each believe that they own the packet, and each has attempted to complete it. The first request succeeds, and the second fails, resulting in this bug check.</p>
<p>Tracking down which drivers in the system caused the error is difficult, because the trail of the first driver has been covered by the second. However, the driver stack for the current request can be found by examining the device object fields in each of the stack locations. </p>

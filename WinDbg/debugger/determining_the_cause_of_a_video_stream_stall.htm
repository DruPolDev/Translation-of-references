</div>
<p>There are two basic causes for a video stream stall:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>A hang.  </b>Either a user-mode thread or a kernel-mode thread is not being released by the driver.</p>
</li>
<li><b>A stall.  </b>This is the result of a problem with a component in the streaming path.  Some possibilities include:<ul>
<li>  The capture driver is not completing packets.  In this case, either a driver component or the hardware might be the source of the stall.</li>
<li>  The capture driver has no packets to complete.  In this case, the buffers might be stalled in a codec or other downstream component.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can reproduce the problem, attach a debugger at this point to determine which is the actual cause.  </p>
<p class="proch"><img src="../common/wedge.gif" alt=""/><b>To determine if the problem is a hang
     </b></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Attach a user-mode debugger to the application and look for blocked user-mode threads. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine whether the application is responsive.  Can the graph be paused?  Can the graph be stopped?  Does streaming restart if the graph is stopped and restarted?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the application is non-responsive, attempt to end the task by using Task Manager.  If this fails, there is a kernel-mode hang.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="proch"><img src="../common/wedge.gif" alt=""/><b>To determine if the problem is a stall
     </b></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Determine where the samples are in the graph.  This can be done locally or in a kernel-mode debugging session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine whether samples are flowing downstream. If you can reproduce the bug in <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=9230">GraphEdit</a>, place an intermediate filter in the graph to display samples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine if the processing routine is being called.  This can be done by attaching a kernel-mode debugger and setting a breakpoint in this routine. </p>
</li>
</ol>

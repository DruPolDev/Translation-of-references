<p>The debugger can transmit certain commands to the Microsoft Windows environment in which the debugger is running.</p>
<p>You can use the <a href="_shell__command_shell_.htm"><b>.shell (Command Shell)</b></a> command in any Windows debugger. With this command, you can execute an application or a Microsoft MS-DOS command directly from the debugger. If you are performing <a href="remote_debugging.htm">remote debugging</a>, these shell commands are executed on the server.</p>
<p>The <a href="_noshell__prohibit_shell_commands_.htm"><b>.noshell (Prohibit Shell Commands)</b></a> command or the <b>-noshell</b> <a href="command_line_options.htm">command-line option</a> disables all shell commands. The commands are disabled while the debugger is running, even if you begin a new debugging session. The commands remain disabled even if you issue a <a href="_restart__restart_kernel_connection_.htm"><b>.restart (Restart Kernel Connection)</b></a> command in KD.  </p>
<p>If you are running a debugging server,you might want to disable shell commands. If the shell is available, a remote connection can use the <b>.shell</b> command to change your computer.</p>
<h3><a id="network_drive_control"></a><a id="NETWORK_DRIVE_CONTROL"></a>Network Drive Control</h3>
<p>In WinDbg, you can use the <a href="file___map_network_drive.htm">File | Map Network Drive</a> and <a href="file___disconnect_network_drive.htm">File | Disconnect Network Drive</a> commands to control the network drive mappings. These changes always occur on the computer that WinDbg is running on, never on any computer that is remotely connected to WinDbg.</p>

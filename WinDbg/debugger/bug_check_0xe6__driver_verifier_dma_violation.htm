<h2>Cause</h2>
<p>See the description of each code in the Parameters section for a description of the cause.</p>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>This bug check can only occur when Driver Verifier has been instructed to monitor one or more drivers. If you did not intend to use Driver Verifier, you should deactivate it. You might also consider removing the driver that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If you are the driver writer, use the information obtained through this bug check to fix the bugs in your code.</p>
<p>The Driver Verifier <b>DMA Verification</b> option is only available in Windows XP and later versions. For full details on Driver Verifier, see the Windows Driver Kit.  </p>

<h2>Cause</h2>
<p>An IRP that had a  <i>Cancel</i>  routine set was completed normally, without cancellation. But after it was complete, a driver called the IRP's <i>Cancel</i> routine.</p>
<p>This could be caused by a driver that completed the IRP and then attempted to cancel it.</p>
<p>It could also be caused by two drivers each trying to access the same IRP in an improper way.</p>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>The cancel routine parameter can be used to determine which driver or stack caused the bug check.</p>

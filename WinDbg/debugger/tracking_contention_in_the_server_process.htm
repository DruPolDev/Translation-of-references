<p>In order to service incoming requests, RPC will maintain a set of worker threads. Ideally, the number of threads will be small. However, this ideal situation has only been seen in lab environments, where the server manager routines are carefully tuned. In a real situation, the number of threads will vary depending on server workload, but it can be anywhere from 1 to 50.</p>
<p>If the number of worker threads is above 50, you may have excessive contention in the server process. Common causes of this are indiscriminate use of the heap, memory pressure, or serializing most activities in a server through a single critical section.</p>
<p>To see the number of threads in a given server process, use the <a href="_rpcexts_getthreadinfo.htm"><b>!rpcexts.getthreadinfo</b></a> extension, or use DbgRpc with the <b>-t</b> switch. Supply the process ID (in the following example, 0xC4):</p>

<p>In this case, there are only seven worker threads, which is reasonable.</p>
<p>If there are over 100 threads, a debugger should be attached to this process and the cause investigated.</p>
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    Running queries such as <b>dbgrpc -t</b> remotely is expensive to the server and the network. If you use this query in a script, you should make sure this command is not run too often.</div>

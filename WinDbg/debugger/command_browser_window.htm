</div>
<p>A Command Browser window displays and stores the text results of a debugger command. This window creates a command reference that enables you to view the results of a specific command without re-entering the command. A Command Browser window also provides navigation through the stored commands, so you can more quickly access commands than with the <a href="debugger_command_window.htm">Debugger Command window</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="opening_the_command_browser_window"></a><a id="OPENING_THE_COMMAND_BROWSER_WINDOW"></a>Opening the Command Browser Window</h3>
<p>You can open multiple Command Browser windows at one time. To open a Command Browser window, choose <b>Command Browser</b> from the <b>View</b> menu. (You can also press CTRL+N or click the<b> Command Browser</b>   button (<img src="images/window-command-browser-icon.PNG" alt="Screen shot of the Command Browser button"/>) on the toolbar.  ALT+SHIFT+N closes the Command Browser window.)</p>
<p>You can also open a Command Browser window by entering <a href="_browse__display_command_in_browser_.htm"><b>.browse (Display Command in Browser)</b></a> in the regular Debugger Command window.</p>
<p>The following screen shot shows an example of a Command Browser window.</p><img src="images/window-commandbrowser.png" alt="Screen shot of the Command Browser window"/><h3><a id="using_the_command_browser_window"></a><a id="USING_THE_COMMAND_BROWSER_WINDOW"></a>Using the Command Browser Window</h3>
<p>In the Command Browser window, you can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To enter a command, type it in the <b>Command</b> box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To view the results of a previously entered command, use the <b>Start</b>, <b>Prev</b>, and <b>Next</b> buttons to scroll through the command list, or select one of the preceding 20 commands from the <b>Command</b> menu. To find a command that is not one of the preceding 20 commands, use the <b>Next</b> button.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Command Browser window has a shortcut menu with additional commands. To access the menu, right-click the title bar or click the icon near the upper-right corner of the window (<img src="images/window-command-browser-icon.PNG" alt="Screen shot of the button that displays the Command Browser window toolbar shortcut menu"/>). The following list describes some of the menu commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Start</b>, <b>Prev</b>, and <b>Next</b> move the cursor to the start of the command history or to the previous or next command, respectively. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Add to Recent Commands</b> puts the current command into the <b>Recent Commands</b> menu of the <b>View</b> menu in the WinDbg window. Recent commands are saved in the workspace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Toolbar</b> turns the toolbar on and off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Move to new dock</b> closes the Command Browser window and opens it in a new dock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Always floating</b> causes the window to remain undocked even if it is dragged to a docking location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Move with frame</b> causes the window to move when the WinDbg frame is moved, even if the window is undocked. For more information about docked, tabbed, and floating windows, see <a href="positioning_the_windows.htm">Positioning the Windows</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Commands that you enter in a Command Browser window are executed by the debugger engine, not by the WinDbg user interface.  This means that you cannot enter user interface commands like <a href="_cls__clear_screen_.htm"><b>.cls </b></a> in a Command Browser window. If the user interface is a remote client, the server (not the client) executes the command.</p>
<p>A command that you enter in a Command Browser window executes synchronously, so it does not display output until it has completed. </p>
<p>Command Browser windows are saved in the WinDbg workspace, but the command histories are not saved. Only the current command for each Command Browser window is saved in the workspace.</p>

<p>Two different builds of each NT-based operating system exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>The  (or ) of Windows is the end-user version of the operating system. The system and drivers are built with full optimization, debugging asserts are disabled, and debugging information is stripped from the binaries. A free system and driver are smaller and faster, and it uses less memory.</li>
<li>The  (or ) of Windows serves as a testing and debugging aid.  For details, see checked build.</li>
</ul>
<p>Distribution media containing the free build of the operating system do not have any special labels -- in other words, the CD containing the free build will just be labeled with the Windows version name, and no reference to the type of build.</p>

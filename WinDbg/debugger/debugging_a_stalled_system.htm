<p>There are times when the computer can stop responding without actually initiating a bug check. This "freeze" can appear in a variety of forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The mouse pointer can be moved, but does not affect any windows on the screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The entire screen is still and the mouse pointer does not move, but paging continues between the memory and the disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The screen is still and the disk is silent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the mouse pointer moves or there is paging to the disk, this is usually due to a problem within the Client Server Run-Time Subsystem (CSRSS).</p>
<p>If NTSD is running on CSRSS, press F12 and dump out each thread to see if there is anything out of the ordinary. (See <a href="debugging_csrss.htm">Debugging CSRSS</a> for more details.)</p>
<p>If an examination of CSRSS reveals nothing, then the problem may be with the kernel after all.</p>
<p>If there is no mouse movement or paging, then it is almost certainly a kernel problem.</p>
<p>Analyzing a kernel crash of this sort is generally a difficult task. To begin, break into KD (with <a href="ctrl_c__break_.htm"><b>CTRL+C</b></a>) or WinDbg (with <b>CTRL+BREAK</b>). You can now use the debugger commands to examine the situation.</p>
<p>Some useful techniques in this case include:</p>

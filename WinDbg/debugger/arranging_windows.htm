<p>One useful window arrangement is to combine all of your <a href="source_window.htm">Source windows</a> into a single tabbed collection. The easiest way to do this is by marking your first source window as the tab-dock target for all Source windows by selecting the <b>Set as tab-dock target for window type</b> option in the Source window's short-cut menu. Once this is done, all future Source windows that are opened will automatically be included in a tabbed collection with this first Source window.  The Source window marked as the tab-dock target will not be closed when the <b>Window | Close All Source Windows</b> menu command is selected.  Thus you can set up a placeholder window for the Source windows that will only be closed when you want it to be.  </p>
<p>This collection can occupy half of the WinDbg window or you can put it in a separate dock.</p>
<p>If you want each debugging information window to be completely separate, you can create one dock for each window. This arrangement enables you to minimize or maximize each window separately.</p>
<p>If you want all of your windows to be floating, you should select <b>Always floating</b> on each window's shortcut menu so that you can drag each window independently to any location. </p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use the <a href="window___mdi_emulation.htm">MDI Emulation</a> command on the <b>Window</b> menu. This command makes all of the windows floating windows and constrains them within the frame window. This behavior emulates the behavior of WinDbg before the introduction of docking mode.</p>
<p>If you are using dual monitors, you can put the WinDbg window in one monitor and an extra dock in the other.</p>
<p>Some standard window arrangements for various debugging scenarios are included in the Debugging Tools for Windows package.  For details on these arrangements, see <a href="using_and_customizing_windbg_themes.htm">Using and Customizing WinDbg Themes</a>.</p>

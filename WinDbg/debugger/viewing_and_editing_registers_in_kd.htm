<p>
     Registers are small volatile memory units that are located on the CPU. Many registers are dedicated to specific uses, and other registers are available for user-mode applications to use. The x86-based and x64-based processors have different collections of registers available. For more information about the registers on each processor, see <a href="processor_architecture.htm">Processor Architecture</a>.</p>
<p>In KD, you can view and edit registers by entering the <a href="r__registers_.htm"><b>r (Registers)</b></a> command.  You can customize the display by using several options or by using the <a href="rm__register_mask_.htm"><b>rm (Register Mask)</b></a> command.</p>
<p>Registers are also automatically displayed every time that the target stops. If you are stepping through your code with the <a href="p__step_.htm"><b>p (Step)</b></a> or <a href="t__trace_.htm"><b>t (Trace)</b></a> commands, you see a register display at every step. To stop this display, use the <b>r </b>option when you use these commands.</p>
<p>On an x86-based processor, the <b>r</b> option also controls several one-bit registers known as flags. To change these flags, you use a slightly different syntax than when changing regular registers. For more information about these flags and an explanation of this syntax, see <a href="x86_architecture.htm#x86_flags">x86 Flags</a>.</p>

<p>Remote debugging is the practice of using a remote connection to perform debugging.</p>
<p>Since user-mode debugging is usually done on one machine, remote user-mode debugging typically uses two machines.  In this scenario, one computer contains the  target application and a debugging server, while the other computer contains the debugging client.  An alternate method is to have the target application  and a  process server on one computer, and a  smart client on the other.</p>
<p>Since kernel-mode debugging is usually done on two machines, remote kernel-mode debugging requires three machines. The target computer   is the computer being debugged. The server  is attached to the target; it contains the kernel-mode debugger. The client  is the computer which is controlling the session remotely.  Typically, one computer is the  being debugged, another contains the debugging server, and the third contains the debugging client.</p>
<p>In addition, there are other methods of remote debugging:  using the Remote tool, using a KD connection server, or using a repeater.  The method you should choose depends on the configuration of the machines in question and the available connections.</p>

<p>In some cases, you might need to retrieve symbols for files that are on an isolated computer; that is, a computer that is either not on any network or is on a network that has no symbol store. In that situation, you can use the following procedure to retrieve symbols.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Run SymChk with the <b>/om</b> parameter to create a manifest file that describes the files for which you want to retrieve symbols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move the manifest file to a network that has a symbol store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run SymChk with <b>/im</b> parameter to retrieve symbols for the files described int the manifest file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move the symbol files back to the isolated computer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><a id="example"></a><a id="EXAMPLE"></a>Example</h3>
<p>Suppose yourApp.exe is running on an isolated computer. The following command creates a manifest file that describes all the symbols needed to debug the yourApp.exe pocess.</p>
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>C:\&gt;SymChk /om c:\Manifest\man.txt /ie yourApp.exe

SYMCHK: FAILED files = 0
SYMCHK: PASSED + IGNORED files = 28</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
<p>Now assume you have moved the manifest file to a different computer that is on a network that has access to a symbol store. The following command retrieves the symbols described in the manifest file and places them in the mySymbols folder.</p>
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>C:\&gt;SymChk /im c:\FolderOnOtherComputer\man.txt /s srv*c:\mysymbols*\\aServer\symbols

SYMCHK: myApp.exe             ERROR - Unable to download file. Error reported was 2
. . .
SYMCHK: FAILED files = 28
SYMCHK: PASSED + IGNORED files = 28</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
<p>Now you can move the symbols to the isolated computer and use them for debugging.</p>

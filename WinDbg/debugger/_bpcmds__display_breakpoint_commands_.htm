<p>For more information about and examples of how to use breakpoints, other breakpoint commands and methods of controlling breakpoints, see <a href="using_breakpoints.htm">Using Breakpoints</a>. </p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>If it is unclear whether a particular breakpoint is set at an address, at a symbolic reference, or at a symbol, use the <b>.bpcmds</b> command to shows which breakpoint command was used to create it.  The command that was used to create a breakpoint determines its nature:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="bp__bu__bm__set_breakpoint_.htm"><b>bp (Set Breakpoint)</b></a> command sets a breakpoint at an address. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="bp__bu__bm__set_breakpoint_.htm"><b>bu (Set Unresolved Breakpoint)</b></a> command sets a breakpoint on a symbolic reference. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="bp__bu__bm__set_breakpoint_.htm"><b>bm (Set Symbol Breakpoint)</b></a> command sets a breakpoint on symbols that match a specified pattern. If the <b>/d</b> switch is included, it creates zero or more breakpoints on addresses (like bp), otherwise it creates zero or more breakpoints on symbolic references (like bu). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="ba__break_on_access_.htm"><b>ba (Break on Access)</b></a> command sets a data breakpoint at an address. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The output of <b>.bpcmds</b> reflects the current nature of each breakpoint. Each line of the <b>.bpcmds</b> display begins with the command used to create it (<b>bp</b>, <b>bu</b>, or <b>ba</b>) followed by the breakpoint ID, and then the location of the breakpoint.</p>
<p>If the breakpoint was created by <b>ba</b>, the access type and size are displayed as well.</p>
<p>If the breakpoint was created by <b>bm</b> without the <b>/d</b> switch, the display indicates the breakpoint type as <b>bu</b>, followed by the evaluated symbol enclosed in the <b>@!""</b> token (which indicates it is a literal symbol and not a numeric expression or register). If the breakpoint was created by <b>bm</b> with the <b>/d</b> switch, the display indicates the breakpoint type as <b>bp</b>.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>

<tr>
<td>
<pre>0:000&gt; bp notepad!winmain

  3: 00421200 @!"myprog!openFile"
  4: 00427800 @!"myprog!openFilter"

0:000&gt; bm /d myprog!closef* 
  5: 00421600 @!"myprog!closeFile"

0:000&gt; ba r2 myprog!LoadFile+2E 

0:000&gt; .bpcmds
bu0 notepad!winmain;
bu1 notepad!LoadFile;
bp2 0x0042cc10 ;
bu3 @!"myprog!openFile";
bu4 @!"myprog!openFilter";
bp5 0x00421600 ;
ba6 r2 0x0042cc2e ;</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
<p>In this example, notice that the output of <b>.bpcmds</b> begins with the relevant command ("bu", "bp", or "ba"), followed by the breakpoint number (with no intervening space).</p>
<p>Notice that because breakpoint number 0 was originally set using <b>bp</b>, and then was redefined using <b>bu</b>, the display shows its type as "bu".</p>
<p>Notice also that breakpoints 3, 4, and 5, which were created by the <b>bm</b> commands shown in this example, are displayed as either type "bp" or type "bu", depending on whether the <b>/d</b> switch was included when <b>bm</b> was used.</p>

<h1><a id="debugger.graph_analysis_with_unloadable_modules"></a>Graph Analysis with Unloadable Modules</h1>
</div>
<p>This section describes a scenario that may affect you if you are working with unloadable modules such as KMixer.</p>
<p>After loading, the extension module initializes at the first command usage. At initialization, the extension module checks whether every module is loaded and has correct symbols.  If any individual module is unloaded or has incorrect symbols loaded, the extension disables the library extension which handles identification, dumping, etc. for that module. In this case, you need to manually re-enable the disabled module.</p>
<p>The above situation may occur if you load the extension at boot time. Specifically, you may encounter this scenario if you load Ks.dll and then issue a <a href="_reboot__reboot_target_computer_.htm"><b>.reboot</b></a> command. Or, it could happen if you break into the debugger during boot and load Ks.dll at that point.</p>
<p>In the following example, we are capturing two streams (sndrec32) from a Telex USB microphone. Breaking on <b>splitter!FilterProcess</b> and running <a href="_ks_graph.htm"><b>!ks.graph</b></a> on splitter's filter yields:</p>

<p>In this example, KMixer has been loaded and connected to splitter, but Kmixer does not appear in the graph. There are IRPs queued to splitter's output pin, yet the <b>!ks.graph</b> command is unable to backtrace and discover KMixer. Issue a <a href="_ks_libexts.htm"><b>!ks.libexts details</b></a> command to investigate further:</p>
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>

LibExt Details:
--------------------------------------------------
LibExt "portcls!" :
    Status :  ACTIVE
    This is the port class library extension to the KS DLL.  It supports
    dumping wave cyclic, wave pci, irp streams, and several other upper
    level structures.
    Commands Exported: pciaudio
    Help : pchelp
    Hooks : dump dumpqueue dumpcircuit conv(file) conv(device) graph
LibExt "STREAM!" :
    Status :  ACTIVE
    This is the stream class library extension to the KS DLL.  It supports
    dumping device extensions, filters, streams, and SRBs.
    Hooks : dump enumdevobj graph
LibExt "kmixer!" :
    Status :  INACTIVE
    This is the KMIXER extension to the KS DLL.  It supports
    virtually nothing at this point!
    Hooks : dump graph</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
<p>According to the above output, the KMixer section of the extension is currently disabled (Status : INACTIVE). Since the extension module was first used in a context in which KMixer was not loaded, Ks.dll has disabled the KMixer section of the extension to prevent time-consuming references to an unloaded module.</p>
<p>To enable KMixer explicitly, you can use <a href="_ks_libexts.htm"><b>!ks.libexts</b></a> with the <b>enable</b> parameter, as follows:</p>
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>

<tr>
<td>
<pre>kd&gt; !libexts enable kmixer
LibExt "kmixer" has been enabled.

<p>Remote debugging directly through the debugger is usually the best and easiest method of performing remote debugging.</p>
<p>This technique involves running two debuggers at different locations. The debugger that is actually doing the debugging is called the <i>debugging server</i>. The debugger that is controlling the session from a distance is called the <i>debugging client</i>.</p>
<p>The two computers do not have to be running the same version of Windows; they can be running any version of Windows. The actual debuggers used need not be the same; a WinDbg debugging client can connect to a CDB debugging server, and so on.</p>
<p>However, it is best that the debugger binaries on the two computers both be from the same release of the Debugging Tools for Windows package, or at least both from recent releases.</p>
<p>To set up this remote session, the debugging server is set up first, and then the debugging client is activated. Any number of debugging clients can connect to a debugging server. A single debugger can turn itself into several debugging servers at the same time, to facilitate different kinds of connections.</p>
<p>However, no single debugger can be a debugging client and a debugging server simultaneously.</p>

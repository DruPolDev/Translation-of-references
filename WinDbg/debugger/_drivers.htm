<p>In operating systems prior to Windows XP, the <b>!drivers</b> extension displays a list of all drivers loaded on the target computer, along with summary information about their memory use.</p>
<p>In Windows XP and later versions of Windows, the <b>!drivers</b> extension is obsolete. To display information about loaded drivers and other modules, use the <a href="lm__list_loaded_modules_.htm"><b>lm</b></a> command. The command lm t n displays information in a format very similar to the old <b>!drivers</b> extension.  However, this command will not display the memory usage of the drivers as the <b>!drivers</b> extension did. It will only display the drivers' start and end addresses, image names, and timestamps.  The <a href="_vm.htm"><b>!vm</b></a> and <a href="_memusage.htm"><b>!memusage</b></a> extensions can be used to display memory usage statistics.</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>An explanation of this command's display is given in the following table:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Column</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Base</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The starting address of the device driver code, in hexadecimal. When the memory address used by the code that causes a stop falls between the base address for a driver and the base address for the next driver in the list, that driver is frequently the cause of the fault. For instance, the base for Ncrc810.sys is 0x80654000. Any address between that and 0x8065a000 belongs to this driver.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Code Size</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The size, in kilobytes, of the driver code, in both hexadecimal and decimal.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Data Size</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The amount of space, in kilobytes, allocated to the driver for data, in both hexadecimal and decimal.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Locked</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>
        (Only when Flag 0x2 is used)  The amount of memory locked by the driver. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Resident</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>
        (Only when Flag 0x1 or 0x2 is used)  The amount of the driver's memory that actually resides in physical memory.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Standby</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>
        (Only when Flag 0x1 or 0x2 is used)  The amount of the driver's memory that is on standby. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Loader Entry</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>
        (Only when Flag 0x2 is used)  The loader entry address. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Driver Name</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The driver file name.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Creation Time</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The link date of the driver. Do not confuse this with the file date of the driver, which can be set by external tools. The link date is set by the compiler when a driver or executable file is compiled. It should be close to the file date, but it is not always the same.</p>

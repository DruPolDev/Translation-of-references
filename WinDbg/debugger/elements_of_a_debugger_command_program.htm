<p>A <i>debugger command program</i> is a small application that consists of debugger commands and control flow tokens, such as <b>.if</b>, <b>.for</b>, and <b>.while</b>. (For a full list of control flow tokens and their syntax, see <a href="control_flow_tokens.htm">Control Flow Tokens</a>.)</p>
<p>You can use braces ( <b>{ }</b> ) to enclose a block of statements within a larger command block. When you enter each block, all aliases within the block are evaluated. If you later alter the value of an alias within a command block, commands after that point do not use the new alias value unless they are within a subordinate block.</p>
<p>You cannot create a block by using a pair of braces. You must add a control flow token before the opening brace. If you want to create a block only to evaluate aliases, you should use the <a href="_block.htm"><b>.block</b></a> token before the opening brace.</p>
<p>A debugger command program can use <a href="using_aliases.htm">user-named aliases or fixed-name aliases</a> as its local variables. If you want to use numeric or typed variables, you can use the <b>$t</b><i>n</i><a href="pseudo_register_syntax.htm">pseudo-registers</a>.</p>
<p>User-named aliases are evaluated only if they are not next to other text. If you want to evaluate an alias that is next to other text, use the <a href="_______alias_interpreter_.htm"><b>${ }  (Alias Interpreter)</b></a> token. This token has optional switches that enable you to evaluate the alias in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>You can add comments to a debugger command program by using two dollar signs (<a href="_____comment_specifier_.htm"><b>$$  (Comment Specifier)</b></a>). You should not insert a comment between a token and its elements (such as braces or conditions).</p>
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    You should not use an asterisk (<a href="____comment_line_specifier_.htm"><b>*  (Comment Line Specifier)</b></a>). Because comments that are specified with an asterisk do not end with a semicolon, the rest of the program is disregarded.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>Typically, you should use MASM syntax within a debugger command program. When you have to use C++ elements (such as specifying a member of a structure or class), you can use the <b>@@c++( )</b> token to switch to C++ syntax for that clause. </p>
<p>The <b>$scmp</b>, <b>$sicmp</b>, and <b>$spat</b> string operators in MASM syntax are particularly useful. For more information about these operators, see <a href="masm_numbers_and_operators.htm">MASM Numbers and Operators</a>.</p>

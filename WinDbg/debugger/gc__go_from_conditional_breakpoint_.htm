<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>When a <a href="setting_a_conditional_breakpoint.htm">conditional breakpoint</a> includes an execution command at the end, this should be the <b>gc</b> command.</p>
<p>For example, the following is a proper conditional breakpoint formulation:</p>
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>0:000&gt; bp Address "j (Condition) 'OptionalCommands'; 'gc' " </pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>
<p>When this breakpoint is encountered and the expression is false, execution will resume using the same execution type that was previously used. For example, if you used a <b>g (Go)</b> command to reach this breakpoint, execution would resume freely.  But if you reached this breakpoint while stepping or tracing, execution would resume with a step or a trace.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the following is an improper breakpoint formulation, since execution will always resume freely even if you had been stepping before reaching the breakpoint:</p>
<div class="code"><span codelanguage=""><table>
<tr>
<th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>0:000&gt; bp Address "j (Condition) 'OptionalCommands'; 'g' " </pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table></span></div>

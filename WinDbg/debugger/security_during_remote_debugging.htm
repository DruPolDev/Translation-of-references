<p>There are two ways to increase security during remote debugging: by restricting who can connect to your session and by restricting the powers of someone who does connect.</p>
<h3><a id="controlling_access_to_the_debugging_session"></a><a id="CONTROLLING_ACCESS_TO_THE_DEBUGGING_SESSION"></a>Controlling Access to the Debugging Session</h3>
<p>If you are performing <a href="remote_debugging_through_the_debugger.htm">remote debugging through the debugger</a>, or using a <a href="process_servers__user_mode_.htm">process server</a> or <a href="kd_connection_servers__kernel_mode_.htm">KD connection server</a>, any computer on your local network can attempt to attach to your debugging session.</p>
<p>If you are using the TCP, 1394, COM, or named pipe protocols, you can require the Debugging Client to supply a password. However, this password is not encrypted during transmission, and therefore these protocols are not secure.</p>
<p>If you want your Debugging Server to be secure, you must use secure sockets layer (SSL) or secure pipe (SPIPE) protocol.</p>
<p>If you are performing <a href="remote_debugging_through_remote_exe.htm">remote debugging through remote.exe</a>, you can use the <b>/u</b> parameter to prohibit connections from unauthorized users.</p>
<h3><a id="restricting_the_powers_of_the_client"></a><a id="RESTRICTING_THE_POWERS_OF_THE_CLIENT"></a>Restricting the Powers of the Client</h3>
<p>If you are setting up a kernel-mode debugging session, you can restrict the debugger's ability to interfere with the host machine by using <a href="secure_mode.htm">Secure Mode</a>.</p>
<p>In user mode, Secure Mode is not available. You can stop an intrusive client from issuing Microsoft MS-DOS commands and running external programs by issuing the <a href="_noshell__prohibit_shell_commands_.htm"><b>.noshell (Prohibit Shell Commands)</b></a> command. However, there are many other ways for a client to interfere with your computer.</p>
<p>Note that both Secure Mode and <b>.noshell</b> will prevent both the Debugging Client and the Debugging Server from taking certain actions. There is no way to place a restriction on the client but not on the server.</p>
<h3><a id="forgotten_process_servers"></a><a id="FORGOTTEN_PROCESS_SERVERS"></a>Forgotten Process Servers</h3>
<p>When you start a process server on a remote machine, the process server runs silently.</p>
<p>If you perform remote debugging through this process server and then end the session, the process server continues to run.</p>
<p>A forgotten process server is a potential target for an attack. You should always shut down an unneeded process server. Use the Kill.exe utility or Task Manager to terminate the process server.</p>

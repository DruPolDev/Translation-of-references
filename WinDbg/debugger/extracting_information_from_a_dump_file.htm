<p>Certain kinds of information, such as the name of the target computer, are easily available during live debugging. When debugging a dump file it takes a little more work to determine this information.</p>
<h3><a id="finding_the_computer_name_in_a_kernel_mode_dump_file"></a><a id="FINDING_THE_COMPUTER_NAME_IN_A_KERNEL_MODE_DUMP_FILE"></a>Finding the Computer Name in a Kernel-Mode Dump File</h3>
<p>If you need to determine the name of the computer on which the crash dump was made, you can use the <a href="_peb.htm"><b>!peb</b></a> extension and look for the value of COMPUTERNAME it its output.  </p>
<p>Or you can use the following command: </p>
<pre class="syntax" xml:space="preserve"><code>0: kd&gt; x srv!SrvComputerName
be8ce2e8  srv!SrvComputerName  = _UNICODE_STRING "AIGM-MYCOMP-PUB01"</code></pre>
<h3><a id="finding_the_ip_address_in_a_kernel_mode_dump_file"></a><a id="FINDING_THE_IP_ADDRESS_IN_A_KERNEL_MODE_DUMP_FILE"></a>Finding the IP Address in a Kernel-Mode Dump File</h3>
<p>To determine the IP address of the computer on which the crash dump was made, find a thread stack that shows some send/receive network activity. Open one of the send packets or receive packets. The IP address will be visible in that packet.</p>
<h3><a id="finding_the_process_id_in_a_user_mode_dump_file"></a><a id="FINDING_THE_PROCESS_ID_IN_A_USER_MODE_DUMP_FILE"></a>Finding the Process ID in a User-Mode Dump File</h3>
<p>To determine the process ID of the target application from a user-mode dump file, use the <a href="___process_status_.htm"><b>| (Process Status)</b></a> command. This will display all the processes being debugged at the time the dump was written. The process marked with a period (<b>.</b>) is the current process. Its process ID is given in hexadecimal after the <b>id:</b> notation.</p>

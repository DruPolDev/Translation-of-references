<p>The <a href="introduction.htm#debugger_engine">debugger engine</a> can directly read and write the target's main memory, registers, and other data spaces.  In kernel-mode debugging, all of the target's memory is available, including virtual memory, physical memory, registers, Model Specific Registers (MSRs), System Bus Memory, Control-Space Memory, and I/O Memory.  In user-mode debugging, only the virtual memory and registers are available.</p>
<p>The engine exposes, to the clients, all memory in the target using 64-bit addresses.  If the target uses 32-bit addresses, when communicating with the target and the clients, the engine will automatically convert between 32-bit and 64-bit addresses, as needed.  If a 32-bit address is recovered from the target--for example, by reading from memory or a register--it must be sign-extended to 64 bits before it can be used in the debugger engine API.  Sign extension is performed automatically by the <b>ReadPointersVirtual</b> method.</p>

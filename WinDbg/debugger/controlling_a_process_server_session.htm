<p>Once the remote session has been started, the smart client can be used as if it were debugging a target application on a single machine. All commands will behave as they would in this situation, except that paths are relative to the smart client's computer.</p>
<h3><a id="using_windbg_as_a_smart_client"></a><a id="USING_WINDBG_AS_A_SMART_CLIENT"></a>Using WinDbg as a Smart Client</h3>
<p>After WinDbg is started as a smart client for a user-mode process server, it will remain attached to the process server permanently. If the debugging session is ended, the <a href="file___attach_to_a_process.htm">File | Attach to a Process</a> menu command or the <a href="_tlist__list_process_ids_.htm"><b>.tlist (List Process IDs)</b></a> command will display all processes running on the computer running the process server. WinDbg can attach to any of these processes.</p>
<p>The <a href="file___open_executable.htm">File | Open Executable</a> command cannot be used. A new process can only be spawned if it is included on the WinDbg command line.</p>
<p>In this situation, WinDbg will not be able to debug processes on the computer where it is running, nor will it be able to start a kernel debugging session.</p>
<h3><a id="ending_the_session"></a><a id="ENDING_THE_SESSION"></a>Ending the Session</h3>
<p>CDB or WinDbg can exit or end the debugging session in the normal fashion. See <a href="ending_a_debugging_session_in_windbg.htm">Ending a Debugging Session in WinDbg</a> for details. The process server will remain in operation and can be re-used as many times as desired. (It can also be used by for any number of simultaneous debugging sessions.)</p>
<p>The process server can be terminated from either computer.  To terminate it from the smart client, use the <a href="_endpsrv__end_process_server_.htm"><b>.endpsrv (End Process Server)</b></a> command.  To terminate the process server from the computer it is running on, use Task Manager to end the dbgsrv.exe process.  </p>

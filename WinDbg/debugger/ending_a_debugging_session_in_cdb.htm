<p>You can exit CDB by entering the <a href="q__qq__quit_.htm"><b>q (Quit)</b></a> command. This command also closes the application that you are debugging.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="qd__quit_and_detach_.htm"><b>qd (Quit and Detach)</b></a> command detaches CDB from the target application, exits the debugger, and leaves the target application running. If you used the <b>-pd</b> command-line option when you started the debugger, detaching occurs if the session is ended for any reason. (This technique makes <b>-pd</b> especially useful when you are debugging a sensitive process, such as the Client Server Run-Time Subsystem (CSRSS), that you do not want to end.)</p>
<p>If the debugger is not responding, you can exit by pressing <a href="ctrl_b__quit_local_debugger_.htm"><b>CTRL+B</b></a> and then ENTER. This method is a secondary exit mechanism. It abruptly ends the debugger and is similar to ending a process through Task Manager or by closing the window.</p>
<p>To end a user-mode debugging session, return the debugger to dormant mode, and close the target application, you can use the following method:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enter the <a href="_kill__kill_process_.htm"><b>.kill (Kill Process)</b></a> command.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To end a user-mode debugging session, return the debugger to dormant mode, and set the target application running again, you can use the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
         Enter the <a href="_detach__detach_from_process_.htm"><b>.detach (Detach from Process)</b></a> command. If you are debugging multiple targets, this command detaches from the current target and continues the debugging session with the remaining targets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
         Enter the <a href="qd__quit_and_detach_.htm"><b>qd (Quit and Detach)</b></a> command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
         Enter the <a href="q__qq__quit_.htm"><b>q (Quit)</b></a> command, if you started the debugger with the <b>-pd</b> option. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To end a user-mode debugging session, return the debugger to dormant mode, but leave the target application in the debugging state, you can use the following method:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
         Enter the <a href="_abandon__abandon_process_.htm"><b>.abandon (Abandon Process)</b></a> command.</p>
</li>
</ul>

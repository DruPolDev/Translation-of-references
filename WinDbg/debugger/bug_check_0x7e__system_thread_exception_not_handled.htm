<h2>Cause</h2>
<p>The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT indicates an unaligned data reference was encountered. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT indicates a breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the Ntstatus.h file that is located in the inc directory of the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p>If you are not equipped to use the Windows debugger to work on   this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also disable memory caching/shadowing of the BIOS might to try to resolve the error. You should also run hardware diagnostics,  that the system manufacturer supplies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirm that any new hardware that is installed is compatible with the installed version of Windows. For example, you can get information about required hardware at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications">Windows 10

Specifications</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For additional general troubleshooting information, see <a href="blue_screen_data.htm"><b>Blue Screen Data</b></a>. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>If you plan to debug this problem, </b>Parameter 2 (the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>The <a href="_analyze.htm"><b>!analyze</b></a> debug extension displays information about  the bug check and can be very helpful in determining the root cause.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system was started with the <b>/NODEBUG</b> switch. This problem should not occur frequently. If it occurs repeatedly, make sure that a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the <b>/DEBUG</b> switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame supplies additional information.</p>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver.  If the issue is narrowed down to a single driver, set breakpoints and single step in code to work to locate the failure and gain insight into events leading up to the crash.</p>

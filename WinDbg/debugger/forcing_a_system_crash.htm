<p>Once kernel-mode dump files have been <a href="enabling_a_kernel_mode_dump_file.htm">enabled</a>, most system crashes should cause a crash file to be written and the blue screen to be displayed.</p>
<p>However, there are times that a system freezes without actually initiating a kernel crash. Possible symptoms of such a freeze include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The mouse pointer moves, but can't do anything. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All video is frozen, the mouse pointer does not move, but paging continues. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no response at all to the mouse or keyboard, and no use of the disk.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If an experienced debugging technician is present, he or she can hook up a kernel debugger and analyze the problem. For some tips on what to look for when this situation occurs, see <a href="debugging_a_stalled_system.htm">Debugging a Stalled System</a>.</p>
<p>However, if no technician is present, you may wish to create a kernel-mode dump file and send it to an off-site technician. This dump file can be used to analyze the cause of the error.</p>
<p>There are two ways to deliberately cause a system crash:</p>

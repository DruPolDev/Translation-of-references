<p>Debugging extensions for Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) are contained in the Wdfkd.dll extension library.</p>
<p>You can use the extension commands that the Wdfkd.dll extension library contains to debug drivers that use KMDF. </p>
<p>For a description of the extension commands in Wdfkd.dll, see <a href="kernel_mode_driver_framework_extensions__wdfkd_dll_.htm">Kernel-Mode Driver Framework Extensions (Wdfkd.dll)</a>. </p>
<p>These extensions can be used on Microsoft Windows XP and later operating systems. Some extensions have additional restrictions; these restrictions are noted on the individual reference pages. </p>
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  When you create a new KMDF or UMDF driver, you must select a driver name that has 32 characters or less. This length limit is defined in wdfglobals.h.  If your driver name exceeds the maximum length, your driver will fail to load.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>To use this extension library, you must load the library into your debugger. For information about how to load extension libraries into a debugger, see <a href="loading_debugger_extension_dlls.htm">Loading Debugger Extension DLLs</a>.</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>The display includes the driver name, the device object address, and the device extension address for each adapter. The display for each adapter also includes a list of each device on the adapter. The display for each device includes the device extension address, the SCSI address, the device object address, and some flags for the device. Information about the Plug and Play state and the power state is also included.</p>
<p>The flags in the display are explained in the following table:</p>

</div>
<p>You can use KD or CDB with the <b>-QR</b> command-line option to obtain a list of available process servers that are running on a network server computer.</p>
<p>This list may include servers that no longer exist but which were not shut down properly -- connecting to one of these generates an error message. The list will also include debugging servers and KD connection servers. The server type will be indicated in each case.</p>
<p>The syntax for this is as follows:</p>
<pre class="syntax"><i>Debugger</i><b> -QR \\</b><i>Server</i></pre>
<h2><a id="ddk_searching_for_process_servers_dbg"></a><a id="DDK_SEARCHING_FOR_PROCESS_SERVERS_DBG"></a></h2>
<p><i>Debugger</i> can be either KD or CDB -- the display will be the same in either case. The two backslashes (<b>\\</b>) preceding <i>Server</i> are optional.</p>
<p>In WinDbg, you can use the <b>Connect to Remote Stub Server</b> dialog box to browse a list of available process servers. See <a href="file___connect_to_remote_stub.htm">File | Connect to Remote Stub</a> for more details.</p>
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  For a process server to be discoverable, it must be activated with elevated privileges. For more information, see <a href="activating_a_process_server.htm">Activating a Process Server</a>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>  <p class="note">If you are not logged on to the client computer with an account that has access to the server computer, you might need to provide a user name and password. On the client computer, in a Command Prompt window, enter the following command.</p><b>net use \\</b><i>Server</i><b>\ipc$ /user:</b><i>UserName</i><p class="note">where <i>Server</i> is the name of the server computer, and <i>UserName</i> is the name of an account that has access to the server computer.</p>
<p class="note">When you are prompted, enter the password for <i>UserName</i>.</p>
<p class="note">After this command succeeds, you can discover process servers (running on the server computer) by using  <b>-QR</b> or <b>Connect to Remote Stub</b>.</p>

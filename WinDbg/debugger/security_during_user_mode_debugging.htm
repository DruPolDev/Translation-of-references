<p>When a user-mode debugger is active, it can effectively control any of the processes on the computer.</p>
<p>There are three possible ways in which security problems could arise during user-mode debugging:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you use corrupt or destructive extension DLLs, they could cause your debugger to take unexpected actions, possibly affecting applications other than your target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is possible that corrupt or destructive symbol files could also cause your debugger to take unexpected actions, possibly affecting applications other than your target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are running a remote debugging session, an unexpected client might attempt to link to your server. Or perhaps the client you are expecting might attempt to perform actions that you do not anticipate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For suggestions on how to guard against unexpected remote connections, see <a href="security_during_remote_debugging.htm">Security During Remote Debugging</a>. After a remote client has joined a user-mode debugging session, there is no way to restrict its access to processes on your computer.  </p>
<p>If you are not performing remote debugging, you should still beware of bad symbol files and extension DLLs. do not load symbols or extensions that you distrust!</p>

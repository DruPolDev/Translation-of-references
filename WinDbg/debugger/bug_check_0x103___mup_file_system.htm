</div>
<p>The MUP_FILE_SYSTEM bug check has a value of 0x00000103. This bug check indicates that the multiple UNC provider (MUP) has encountered invalid or unexpected data. As a result, the MUP cannot channel a remote file system request to a network redirector, the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) provider. </p>

<p>The MUP could not locate the file context that corresponds to a file object. This typically indicates that the MUP is seeing an I/O request for a file object for which MUP did not see a corresponding IRP_MJ_CREATE request. The likely cause of this bug check is a filter driver error.</p>

<p>This bug check occurs only when you are using a Checked Build of Windows  and should only be caused by file system filter drivers that are attached to legacy network redirectors. Legacy redirectors use <b>FsRtlRegisterUncProvider</b>  to register with MUP. This bug check detects filter drivers that return an NTSTATUS that is not STATUS_SUCCESS in IRP_MJ_CLEANUP or IRP_MJ_CLOSE requests.</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>The MUP maintains context information on a per-file object basis for all file objects it handles. </p>

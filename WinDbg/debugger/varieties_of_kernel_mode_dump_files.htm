<p>There are five settings for kernel-mode crash dump files:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<p><a href="complete_memory_dump.htm">Complete Memory Dump</a></p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p><a href="kernel_memory_dump.htm">Kernel Memory Dump</a></p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p><a href="small_memory_dump.htm">Small Memory Dump</a></p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p><a href="automatic_memory_dump.htm">Automatic Memory Dump</a></p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Active Memory Dump</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The difference between these dump files is one of size. The <i>Complete Memory Dump</i> is the largest and contains the most information, the <i>Kernel Memory Dump</i> is somewhat smaller, and the <i>Small Memory Dump</i> is only 64 KB in size.</p>
<p>If you select <i>Automatic Memory Dump</i>, the dump file is the same as a Kernel Memory Dump, but Windows has more flexibility in setting the size of the system paging file.</p>
<p>The advantage to the larger files is that, since they contain more information, they are more likely to help you find the cause of the crash.</p>
<p>The advantage of the smaller files is that they are smaller and written more quickly. Speed is often valuable; if you are running a server, you may want the server to reboot as quickly as possible after a crash, and the reboot will not take place until the dump file has been written.</p>
<p>After a Complete Memory Dump or Kernel Memory Dump has been created, it is possible to create a Small Memory Dump file from the larger dump file. See the <a href="_dump__create_dump_file_.htm"><b>.dump (Create Dump File)</b></a> command for details.</p>
<div class="alert"><b>Note</b>    Much information can be obtained by analyzing a kernel-mode dump file. However, no kernel-mode dump file can provide as much information as actually debugging the crash directly with a kernel debugger.</div>

The Linux debugger has the following particularities and limitations:
<p>
- The debugger server can handle only one IDA client at a time
<p>
- By default, the 64-bits debugger will try to load &quot;libunwind-x86_64.so.8&quot;
  and &quot;libunwind-ptrace.so.0&quot; in order to help with stack recovery.
<p>
- ARMLinux: hardware breakpoints are not supported
<p>
- ARMLinux: floating point registers are not supported
<p>
- ARMLinux: The THUMB mode is not supported
<p>
- Configure the debugger specific options (for 64 bits only) in
    Debugger Options, Set specific options.

  - Path to libunwind:
    - &quot;libunwind-x64_64.so.8&quot; (the default): the debugger will try to load
      libunwind &quot;libunwind-x86_64.so.8&quot; + &quot;libunwind-ptrace.so.0&quot; pair
      using the regular 'ld' search path.
    - &quot;libunwind-x64_64.so&quot; (note the lack of &quot;.8&quot; at the end): like the
      default, except the debugger will look for &quot;libunwind-x86_64.so&quot;
      and &quot;libunwind-ptrace.so&quot; (this is particularly useful for working
      with libunwind &quot;dev&quot; packages)
    - absolute path to libunwind-x64_64.so.8 or libunwind-x64_64.so: Linux debugger
      will try to load libunwind only from the provided path.
    - absolute path to &quot;libunwind-x64_64.so[.8]&quot;: the debugger will try
      to load the two libraries from there (the absolute path to
      &quot;libunwind-ptrace.so[.0]&quot; will be derived from that of
      &quot;libunwind-x64_64.so[.8]&quot;)
    - left blank: don't use libunwind to collect stack traces.
</pre>
<pre>
  By default this is set to libunwind-x86_64.so meaning the default
  path will be used to load libunwind-x86_64.so(.8) and libunwind-ptrace.so(.0). If an absolute
  path is provided, both libraries will be loaded from this path. If left emtpy, the call
  stack will be analysed by Ida and not libunwind.

Some IDA commands such as selecting a portion of file to output or specifying a segment to move need an anchor.
<p>
To drop the anchor, you can either use the Alt-L key or the Shift-&lt;arrow&gt; combination, which is more convenient.
You can also drop the anchor with the mouse by simply clicking and dragging it.
<p>
After you've dropped the anchor, you can navigate freely using arrows, etc.
Any command that uses the anchor, raises it.
<p>
The anchored range is displayed with another color.
<p>
When you exit from IDA, the anchor value is 
lost.</p></BODY></HTML>

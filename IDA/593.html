 Action    name: OpenStructures
 </pre>
This command opens the structure definitions window.
<p>
You can modify structure definitions here: add/rename/delete structures,
add/delete/define structure members.
<p>
Each structure must have a unique name. A field name must be unique in the
structure. In order to create or delete a field, use data definitions
commands (<A href="453.html">data</a>, <A href="454.html">string literal</a>, <A href="455.html">array</a>, <A href="456.html">undefine</a>, <A href="457.html">Rename</a>).
You may also define <A href="479.html">regular</a> or <A href="480.html">repeatable</a> comments.
<p>
In order to modify member types, use commands from the <A href="458.html">Edit|Operand types...</a> submenu.
For example, to convert a structure member to an offset, use one of the following
commands:
<pre>
      <A href="468.html">Convert to offset (automatic)</a>
      <A href="467.html">Convert to offset (from a segment base)</a>
      <A href="470.html">Convert to offset (complex offset expression)</a>
</pre>
Some struct types in this window are created automatically by IDA. They are
copies of some local types. Such structs are displayed in gray. They are
considered as C-level types. As soon as the user edits such a type, it becomes
an ASM-level type. Read <A href="1042.html">more</a>.
<p>
In the structure header IDA displays the following info:
<pre>
  - the structure size in bytes
  - the alignment
  - for C level types: copyof_XX where XX is the ordinal type number.
  - for ASM level types: mappedto_XX where XX is the ordinal type number.
    It is possible to jump to the corresponding local type by pressing Enter.
  - for types copied from standard type libraries: "standard type"

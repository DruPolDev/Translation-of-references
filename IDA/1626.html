Starting from IDA v6.2, the callgraph of a program can be displayed in a
graph form.
<p>
In the proximity view, the current address, the callers and the callees
are represented as a collection of nodes linked together with edges. Nodes
represent functions and data references (global variables, strings, etc..)
and edges represent code or data cross-references between them.
<p>
To open the proximity view press the '-' key to zoom out and switch to the
callgraph of the address under cursor.
<p>
Only the address names (function names or data labels) are displayed in the proximity view, but not the
disassembly, nonetheless, hovering the mouse over a node will display brief disassembly listing in a
resizable hint window. To see the complete disassembly listing switch to text or graph mode by pressing
'+' or Space respectively.
<p>
When disassembling new files, IDA will display a dialog offering to switch to proximity view
when applicable. It is possible to turn off this dialog and not show it again.
<p>
In the proximity view there are 3 types of nodes: Function nodes, data nodes
and auxiliar nodes. Function nodes are rectangular and they have a toolbar.
Those nodes are used to display the callers or callees of the current
central node (or any of his parents or children). Data nodes
are rectangular nodes (without a toolbar) and they are used to display the
data references (global variables, strings, etc...) to/from the current
central node or any of his parents and children.

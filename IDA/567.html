 Action    name: JumpEntryPoint
 </pre>
This command shows you a list of entry points: you can jump to the selected one by pressing Enter.
<p>
The list of entry points is created at the database creation time.
It is not modified after that (for example, renaming an exported function does
not change the list of entry points).

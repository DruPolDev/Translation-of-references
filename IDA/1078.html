On macOS, the suggested approach is to use <a href="1463.html">Remote debugging</a> with one of the mac_server*
binaries that are shipped with IDA - even when debugging apps on your local machine.
<p>
Using a standalone debug server application makes it easier to get around the codesigning and debugging restrictions
that are built into macOS. Note that this is also the approach used by lldb. Internally lldb uses a dedicated debugserver
that implements the core debugger engine - so IDA does the same.
<p>
It is possible to use the Local Mac OS X Debugger in ida.app, but you must run IDA as root.

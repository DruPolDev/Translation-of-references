Internally, IDA has 32-bit linear address space (IDA64 uses 64-bit address space).
The internal addresses are called &quot;linear addresses&quot;. The input program
is loaded into this linear address space.
<p>
Please note that usually the linear addresses are not used in the program
directly.
During disassembling, we use so-called &quot;virtual addresses&quot;, which
are calculated by the following formula:
<pre>
        VirtualAddress = LinearAddress - (SegmentBase &lt;&lt; 4);
</pre>
We see that the SegmentBase determines what addresses will be
displayed on the screen. More than that, IDA allows to create
several segments with the same virtual address in them. For this,
you just need to create segments with correct segment base values.
<p>
Normally a SegmentBase is a 16bit quantity.
To create a segment with base &gt;= 0x10000, you need to use
<a href="591.html">selectors</a>. However, if you try to create a segment
with a segment base &gt;= 0x10000, IDA will automatically choose appropriately
a free selector and setup for the new segment.
<p>
All SegmentBases are looked up in the <a href="591.html">selector</a> table.
<p>
There are some address restrictions in IDA.
<p>
There is a range of addresses that are used for internal housekeeping. This
range can be specified by the configuration variable PRIVRANGE (start address
and size). It is not recommended to use these addresses for other purposes.
<p>
There is also one address which must never be used in the disassembly.
It is the 'all ones' address, or -1. Internally, it is used as a BADADDR (bad address).
No address or address range can include BADADDR.

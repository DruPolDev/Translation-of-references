<hr>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When customizing a <b>ToolBar</b> object, you will see the following
window:<br><br></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 384px; height: 394px;" alt=""
src="CustomTB.gif" hspace="0"><br><br></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">You have the possibility to add a bitmap resource so that its images might be
associated to tool bar buttons. If so, the bitmap file must be an existing resource in the <b>Image Table</b>
of the Resource Editor. All bitmap resources being there will be available in the tool bar customizing window. After
adding a bitmap resource for a tool bar, Easy Code calculates the number of images by dividing the whole bitmap
file width by the image width (16 pixels by default). If you change the image or button sizes, you will have to
specify the number of images and the image and button sizes for the tool bar buttons to display their image
properly. When referring to button or image indexes, take into account that they are one-based (both, first button
and first image are number <b>1</b>). Images associated to buttons with a <b>Separator</b> style have no effect,
as they are never displayed (their image index should be <b>0</b>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>REMARKS</b>: The index number for each button in a tool bar is also its
<b>ID</b>entifier. At run time, this <b>ID</b>entifier is the one sent to the tool bar "owner window" when
a button is clicked, through the <b><font color="#000080">WM_COMMAND</font></b> message (see the <b>MDI</b>
example coming with Easy Code).<br></font></p>

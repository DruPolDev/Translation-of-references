<hr>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Easy Code
includes
the <b>thread</b> object, which can easily create
threads in any visual application.
A <b>thread</b> object is treated as a child control, so
it has a control identifier
constant as any other control. For more information
on how to get the control identifier, please see
<a href="Visual.htm#childcontrolids"><font face="Arial" size="2">Getting
child control identifiers</font></a>.<br>
<br>
When adding a <b>thread</b>
object to a window, a procedure for
the thread is also created. The name for this procedure will be the
owner
window name plus the <b>thread</b> object name (case
sensitive) as in any
other control. For example, if the thread is named <b>Thread1</b>
and it is
inside a window named <b>Window1</b>, its procedure name
will be
<b>Window1Thread1</b> and this will be the procedure called
by the thread. Taking
that into account, NEVER CHANGE the procedure name manually so that the
thread
can properly work. When you change the thread object name (or
the owner window name) in the Properties window, Easy Code also changes
the thread's procedure name according to the new name.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Also, you can
pass
the address of an existing variable to the thread's procedure
by specifying its name in the <b>Parameter</b> property.
The
address of the specified variable will be passed as the
<b>lpParameter</b> argument. Please see the <a href="Parameter.htm"><b>Parameter</b></a>
property for more information.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After a thread
is created, you may need to get
its handle so that you can change its state and/or priority
(set at design time). If so, just call the <a href="easy4f8t.htm"><b><font color="#800080">GetWindowItem</font></b></a>
method as you do for any other control. Please see the <b>Threads</b>
example in the <b>\EasyCode\Examples</b> folder.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<b>REMARKS</b>: Easy Code can create up to
48 threads for each application. In order to control a thread's
priority and/or state,
please refer to the <font color="#800000"><b>GetThreadPriority</b></font>,
<font color="#800000"><b>SetThreadPriority</b></font>,
<font color="#800000"><b>ResumeThread</b></font>
and <font color="#800000"><b>SuspendThread</b></font>
API functions.</font></p>

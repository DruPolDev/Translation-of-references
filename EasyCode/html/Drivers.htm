<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Easy Code
allows you to get
into NT driver programming. When you choose a <b>Classic
NT driver (sys)</b> project type, a basic structure is
created and the minimum required files are also added.
This NT driver default code can be built without errors,
but it just does nothing.<br>
<br>
In addtiion to the
usual <b>.inc</b> files, NT driver programming requires
some extra <b>.inc</b> files which can be found in the
Easy Code's <b>Include</b> folder. So, in order to avoid
errors when programming a driver, please take into
account the following considerations:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The
driver entry
procedure must <b>ALWAYS</b>
be named <b>DriverEntry</b>
(case sensitive) and so it is expected by the linker.
Otherwise, the corresponding error will be fired at
link time.</font></div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>NEVER</b>
include the <b>windows.inc</b> file (if included,
errors will be fired at compile time). Instead,
<b>ntddk.inc</b> must always be included.</font></div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Any
other file being
used in a project, and not related to Driver Development
Kit, should be placed in the project folder.<br>
</font></div>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
Although Easy Code gives the necessary support,
driver programming is not an easy task, specially for
being debugged, and most programming errors go into a
blue screen (BSOD).<br>
<br>
You can find a simple driver example
(<b>ECPDriver</b>),
which gets all processes running
in the system, and a little application to test it
(<b>ECPDrvTest</b>).
Both have
been programmed by <b>Héctor A.
Medina</b> and are located in the
<b>\EasyCode\Examples</b> folders.</font>
<P></P>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>SPECIAL
THANKS</b> to <b>Héctor
Antonio Medina</b> who has worked very hard to make Easy
Code to be able to include the necessary support for
driver programming.</font></p>

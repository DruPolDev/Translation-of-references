<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Easy Code
allows for the
use of reusable code and comment segments called "code snippets".
&nbsp;Snippets are blocks of program code or programmer comments
which are usually small but may vary in size, purpose, and scope, and
are contained either within a standard text file (*.txt) or an extended
markup language file (*.xml). Snippets generally are formatted in a
template style manner so that a segment of code or comment(s) may be
inserted into a target source file and require minimal postliminary
changes in order for it to work as intended in each particular instance.</font></p>
<p font="" face="Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">To retain simplicity, Easy
Code uses only snippets stored in the standard text format (*.txt). The
new Easy Code "Snippets" subfolder ("..\EasyCode\Snippets") is the
default path to the top-level snippet directory. Using the 'Settings'
dialog form however, the user may specify any alternate top-level
folder in which to store snippets. The user may subsequently create any
number of snippet subfolders within the top-level folder. It is ideal
programming practice to limit each snippet file to only one segment of
code which serves a single function, and name each snippet file
according to the particular function it performs. The user should not
worry about this resulting in having too many snippet files, as each
snippet folder and subfolder can contain an unlimited number of snippet
files. It is also ideal practice to store each snippet file in a folder
of which its name directly corresponds to the grouping or type of
snippet files it contains. For example: all snippet files which deal
with file processing should be placed in a subfolder named something
like 'File Processing'. Snippet files which add comment headers to the
beginning of source files and functions should be placed in a subfolder
named something similar to 'Header Comments'. Snippet files which
handle peripheral input and output should be placed in a subfolder
named 'Input and Output'. And so on, and so on.</font></p>

<p face="Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">NOTE:
The 'Edit --&gt; Snippets' menu
label is statically linked to the top-level snippet folder and will
always retain the name of "Snippets", regardless of what top-level
snippet folder the user might choose to designate. In contrast,
however, any snippet sub-menu labels will always be dynamic, and
therefore, the name of each will reflect the corresponding subfolder
created by the user. Additionally, any snippet menu item will always
reflect the name of its corresponding file - minus the file extension
(txt). Because the name of each snippet file will determine its
identifier to be displayed in the Snippet menu, it is ideal practice to
name each file something meaningful where it can easily be selected
from the menu.</font></p>
<p face="Arial"><font face="Arial" size="2">To
insert a code or comment snippet:
simply set the cursor at the desired location within the target source
file, select Edit --&gt; Snippets from the Easy Code menu and
navigate to the correct subfolder menu label, then click the desired
snippet item.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size="2"><b>REMARKS</b>:
Two code snippets
are included in the "..\EasyCode\Snippets\Header Comments" subfolder.</font></font></p>

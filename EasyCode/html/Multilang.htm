<hr>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Easy Code
takes
advantage of Unicode text strings (<b>UTF-16</b>,
that is, 2 bytes per character) and offers
the
possibility of practically managing
all languages in the IDE. Consequently, text strings are not inside the
executable
file, instead
all text strings used by Easy Code are included in specific files, with
extension
<b>lge</b>,
which have to be located in the <b>Language</b>
subfolder. Each language must
have its own <b>.lge</b>
file in order to be available to Easy Code. For more
information about language files, please refer to the <A href="Language.htm"><b>Language
files</b></a>
topic.
<br>
<br>
If the corresponding <b>.lge</b>
file for your language is missing in the <b>Language</b>
subfolder, you can easily create it yourself. To do so, please follow
the
instructions specified
in the <A href="Language.htm"><b>Language
files</b></a>
topic.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>REMARKS</b>:
If you create a new language file, please send it to me so that I can
include it in next versions of Easy Code. Thank you.

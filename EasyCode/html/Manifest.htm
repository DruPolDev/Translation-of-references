<p><a name="xpthemes"></a><b><font color="#004080" face="Arial" size="6">Including
a Manifest in the project (only exe and dll project type)
</font></b></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A set of new
common
controls has been included
from Windows XP and later versions of Windows, but they only are
available to an
application
if the executable file includes a <b>Manifest</b>.
A Manifest is a text file in XML
format included as a resource in the executable file, so
that it can be able to use the new common controls (see
<a href="XPThemes.htm">Enabling XP themes</a>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Easy Code can
automatically create and include a Manifest in
executable and dll type projects (<b>Visual executable file</b>,
<b>Classic executable file</b> and <b>Classic
dynamic
link library</b>. Please see <a href="EasyCode.htm#startingeasycode">STARTING EASY CODE</a>).
The created file is named <b>Manifest.xml</b>, placed in
the
Project's <b>Res</b> folder and added to the
<b>Manifest</b> node of the Project Explorer, so that it
can be
edited in the Easy Code environment. If a file with the same
name already exists in the <b>Res</b>
folder, Easy Code will use the existing one and no new file
will be created.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When a new
project is
created, the Manifest.xml file is generated and included in
the project only if the <b>Manifest</b> option of
the <b>New project</b> window is selected (please see <a href="EasyCode.htm#startingeasycode">STARTING EASY
CODE</a>). On the other hand, if the project was already
created with no Manifest, and you wish to include one, select
the <b>Manifest</b> option in the <a href="Project.htm#project2">Project Properties</a>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Even if the <b>Manifest.xml</b>
file exists in the <b>Res</b> folder, it will not be
included
if the <b>Manifest</b> option in the <a href="Project.htm#project2">Project Properties</a> is
not
checked.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<b>IMPORTANT</b>: The <font color="#800000"><b>GetVersionEx</b></font>
API function will return the Windows 8 OS version (<font color="#800080"><a href="easy41v1.htm"><b>ecWin8</b></a></font>)
for applications not specifically manifested for Windows 8.1, Windows
10 o Windows 11,
even if they are running on Windows 8.1, Windows 10, or Windows 11. To manifest your applications for Windows 8.1,
Windows 10 or Windows 11, the <b>Manifest</b> file has to include some
additional
lines (for more information, please click this <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn481241%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"><b>link</b></a>).
The default <b>Manifest.xml</b> file generated by Easy
Code
when creating a new project, already includes the necessary
lines for the application to be manifested properly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">
<b>REMARKS</b>: At design time, or when testing a window,
all control objects will be shown with the new common
controls style only if the <b>Manifest</b> option is
selected
in the <a href="Project.htm#project2">Project Properties</a>.
Otherwise, they will be shown with the old controls
style.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>REMARKS</b>:
Take into account that the <b>Manifest.xml</b>
file has no effect for Windows systems prior to XP.</font></p>
